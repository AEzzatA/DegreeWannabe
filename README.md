DegreeWannabe
=============

For Degree wannabes.
The very aim of the application for me is to play with SQLAlchemy and to help me find a proper university to make my MSc. :-)

The applicatin is in very alpha phase, don't expect anything stable.
The only reqirements for now is Python **2.7** and **SQLAlchemy** 0.8.

Comments, critiques and pull requests are more than welcome, you can contact me here or AEzzatA@gmail.com
